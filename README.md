This is a WIP 2D game where you play as an inventor. You invent useful gadgets and weapons using the resources and parts you collect along your adventure!

Pretty bare bones at the moment, you can only run right and left on a ~blank screen.~ New Update allows for creating of basic maps. 
But there are some hand drawn animations in place. 

Right now I'm working on all the base systems that are needed to run the game.
Next up is camera movement (following the character), and collision detection!
Actual gameplay will come much later.
